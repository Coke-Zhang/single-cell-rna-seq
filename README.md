This is the template for a new Snakemake workflow. Replace this text with a comprehensive description covering the purpose and domain.
Insert your code into the respective folders, i.e. `scripts`, `rules`, and `envs`. Define the entry point of the workflow in the `Snakefile` and the main configuration in the `config.yaml` file.

## Usage

### Step 1: Install workflow

If you simply want to use this workflow, download and extract the [latest release](https://github.com/snakemake-workflows/single-cell-rna-seq/releases).
If you intend to modify and further develop this workflow, fork this repository. Please consider providing any generally applicable modifications via a pull request.

In any case, if you use this workflow in a paper, don't forget to give credits to the authors by citing the URL of this repository and, if available, its DOI (see above).

### Step 2: Configure workflow

Configure the workflow according to your needs via editing the files `config.yaml` and `cells.tsv`.

### Step 3: Execute workflow

Test your configuration by performing a dry-run via

    snakemake -n

Execute the workflow locally via

    snakemake --use-conda --cores $N

using `$N` cores. Alternatively, it can be run in cluster or cloud environments (see [the docs](http://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/executable.html) for details).
If you not only want to fix the software stack but also the underlying OS, use

    snakemake --use-conda --use-singularity

in combination with any of the modes above.

### Step 4: Investigate results

After successful execution, you can create a self-contained report with all results via:

    snakemake --report report.html

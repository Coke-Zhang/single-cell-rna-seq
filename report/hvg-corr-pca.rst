PCA plot constructed from normalized log-expression values of correlated HVGs,
where each point represents a cell.

First, second, and third components are shown, along with the percentage of variance
explained. Bars represent the coordinates of the cells on each axis. Each cell
was coloured according to its total number of expressed features.
